# Chips & Compilers Symposium at MLSys '22




Efficient and scalable learning systems need to take full advantage of modern hardware and runtime environments' performance capability. 
The rapid advance in ML models and ML-specific hardware makes this task increasingly challenging. 
This symposium aims to bring together experts from the field of computer architecture and compilers, to discuss about ML-specific hardware, and how to fully use hardware specialization and compilation techniques to provide the best performance for modern machine learning workloads.
